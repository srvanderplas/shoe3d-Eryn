Through these processes, we have found two different differences. The first difference is found through the icp process. In this process, we set the first scan as a base scan. This scan does not move through the process. Once this scan is set, using a K-D tree method the shoe is divided up into sections until there is only one vertex in each section. This process is done to the second shoe as well. Each point is then pair with the closest euclidean distance corresponding point. This is repeated for the set itterations, or until epsilon is deemed small enough. This is done by the following mathematical formula. 




Each time the distance is measured, but the K-D tree sectioning remains the same through the process. This gives us N distances for the number of iterations. We return the final N iteration's distances from each set of verities. The mean of these distances is then computed, giving us a distance metric. This is used to find the magnitude of the distance between the two shoes. In order to find the direction of the distance, positive or negative, we look at the shoes after full alignment. This is done using a K-distance neighbor search as well, within each corresponding shoe made of a mesh object. K closest distance is measured in squared Euclidean distance.For two vectors (w_1,x_1,y_1,z_1) and (w_2,x_2,y_2,z_2), the euclidean distance is found by: 
      (w_1-w_2)^2+(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2
K-D construction is as follows divide the points in half by a line perpendicular to one of the axes, in each tree. Then recursively construct k-d trees for the two sets of points, the two points corresponding to the verities of the triangles. Think of it as this, we first choose a shoe to be set. In this case shoe scan 1. Then for each one of the verticies of a triangle we draw a ball with radius \epsilon then we start epsilon to be 0 and expand it till you hit the closest section with a specified point. Once that point is found, the distance is measured and recorded (without the absolute value). Then taking the mean of these distances, we can get the direction of the differences.
