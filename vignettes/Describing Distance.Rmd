Through these processes, we have found two different differences. The first difference is found through the icp process. We need two processes 

In this process, we set the first scan as a base scan. This scan does not move through the process. Once this scan is set, using a K-D tree method the shoe is divided up into sections until there is only one vertex in each section. This process is done to the second shoe as well. Each point is then pair with the closest euclidean distance corresponding point. This is repeated for the set itterations, or until epsilon is deemed small enough. This is done by the following mathematical formula. 




Each time the distance is measured, but the K-D tree sectioning remains the same through the process. This gives us N distances for the number of iterations. We return the final N iteration's distances from each set of verities. The mean of these distances is then computed, giving us a distance metric. This is used to find the magnitude of the distance between the two shoes. In order to find the direction of the distance, positive or negative, we look at the shoes after full alignment. This is done using a K-distance neighbor search as well, within each corresponding shoe made of a mesh object. K closest distance is measured in squared Euclidean distance.For two vectors (w_1,x_1,y_1,z_1) and (w_2,x_2,y_2,z_2), the euclidean distance is found by: 
      (w_1-w_2)^2+(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+(z_1-z_2)^2
K-D construction is as follows divide the points in half by a line perpendicular to one of the axes, in each tree. Then recursively construct k-d trees for the two sets of points, the two points corresponding to the verities of the triangles. Think of it as this, we first choose a shoe to be set. In this case shoe scan 1. Then for each one of the verticies of a triangle we draw a ball with radius \epsilon then we start epsilon to be 0 and expand it till you hit the closest section with a specified point. Once that point is found, the distance is measured and recorded (without the absolute value). Then taking the mean of these distances, we can get the direction of the differences. 




In order to align the shoes through an automatized process, we need to use the following steps. We begin with the two mesh objects of the same shoe at different time points, say time i and time j. Then using the barycenter, or center of mass, we center the shoes on the same x,y,z, coordinate system. After the shoes are then centered, they are transformed into a point cloud made up of the verities of the triangle mesh object. Using these two coordinate systems. Principal component analysis is performed. This gives us a 3X3 rotation matrix in which to transform the original mesh object by the PCA rotation matrix. The first issue comes in here. Due to the nature of PCA, the rotation matrix that we are using is not unique. Further more it often times has a negative determinate. If this happens, we need to rotate the mesh shoe object by a matrix whose diaginal is (1,1,-1). Leaving us with a positive determinate. After this is done, there is no guarantee that the two shoes although sharing the same space in x,y,z where x is the length of the shoe, y the width and z the depth, will be in the same direction. In order to correct for this we need to rotate the shoes by 180 degrees in x,y,z or a combination of those directions. There are 8 possibilities of those rotations shown below

however, as shown there are only 4 unique matrices. In order to choose which one of these matrices, the first shoe scan in time is set as the base scan. Then each of the four matrices described above is applied to second scan. After each rotation, the distance between the first and second scan is measured (using the equation above) and recorded. The matrix with the smallest distance is used as the rotation matrix, and is applied to the second shoe. Once the shoes are initially alligned, ICP is applied with an iteration of the aligners choosing. Once ICP has been performed, the distance is again measured and recorded.
